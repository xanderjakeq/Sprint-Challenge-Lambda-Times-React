1. Proptypes are used to check the form of data a component is 
    given. This way, developers will be notified if they have
    passed down the wrong data to a component and change it 
    immediately instead of them spending time trying to find
    what they did wrong

2.  A life-cycle event is one of the events in a react component's 
    lifecycle. They could be one of [mount, update, and unmount], 
    developers can choose to do something when these events occur.

3.  Higher Order Components are used to reuse stateful logic to
    other components. It takes in a component as a prop and returns
    a component with a stateful logic that the HOC has passed down 
    to the component prop.

4.  One is Vanilla Css, its the easiest way since there are no
    dependencies to install. Another are with Preprocessors, 
    styling of components can be split up and imported to one less
    files and compile to just one CSS file. I think it the most 
    organizable way to style components. If the developer needs more
    control, then they can try to use Styled-components. Which brings
    in js to the styling and can do dynamic styling based on props
    that components take in.
